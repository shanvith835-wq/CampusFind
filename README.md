# CampusFind – Campus Lost and Found System
> **Lost Something? Find It Here.**
> A modern, responsive, campus-exclusive Lost and Found web application designed for university students, faculty, and campus security.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
**CampusFind** is an intuitive web portal that connects college students who have lost personal belongings with fellow peers and staff who have found them. 
Misplacing essential campus items like student ID cards, scientific calculators, laptops, chargers, keys, and textbooks causes immense stress and productivity loss during semesters. CampusFind provides a unified, centralized bulletin board and recovery workflow that turns lost items into resolved campus reunions.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
On modern university campuses:
- Lost items are scattered across fragmented physical locations (canteen, department desks, library checkouts, security kiosks).
- Students resort to unorganized social media posts or spamming group chats where listings quickly get buried.
- Finders have no standardized way to verify owners or safely notify them without exposing their private credentials.

**CampusFind solves this by offering:**
1. A categorized, searchable, campus-wide live directory of lost and found listings.
2. Standardized item reporting with live photo previews, exact campus building locations, and contact info.
3. A student dashboard to manage reported items, mark items as returned, or safely remove resolved postings.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Modern Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile phones, tablets, and desktop workstations.
- **Global State Management via React Context API**: All listings, status updates, and reports sync globally without external server latency.
- **Instant Search & Multi-Filter System**:
  - Live search by item name, description, or campus building.
  - Category filtering (Electronics, ID & Cards, Bags & Wallets, Books, Keys, etc.).
  - Status tabs (`All`, `Lost`, `Found`, `Returned`).
  - Multi-attribute sorting (`Newest First`, `Oldest First`, `Name A-Z`).
- **Interactive Reporting Forms**:
  - Distinct reporting flows for **Lost** items and **Found** items.
  - Client-side image upload with automatic canvas optimization and persistent Base64 storage (`FileReader` + offscreen canvas), ensuring images survive navigation, refreshes, and render across Home, Dashboard, Item Details, and My Reports.
  - Built-in sample illustration presets for instant testing.
  - Comprehensive form validation with helpful inline error alerts.
- **Student Profile Management & In-Place Editing**:
  - Clickable student profile pill in the navbar and dedicated **"Edit Profile"** buttons in the navbar popover and `/my-reports`.
  - In-place modal to edit **Name**, **Campus Email**, and **Phone Number** (with optional Department and Student ID).
  - Dynamic avatar initials that recalculate automatically.
  - Instant synchronization with global Context and `localStorage`, automatically updating reporter contact info across the app.
- **Detailed Item View (`/items/[id]`)**:
  - High-resolution item illustration/photo display.
  - Dynamic status badge indicator (Lost = Red, Found = Green, Returned = Blue).
  - One-click RFC `mailto:` generator pre-populating item ID, location, and details for quick student-to-student outreach.
  - Direct call link (`tel:`) for immediate phone contact.
  - Custom 404 handler for non-existent item IDs.
- **Simulated Student Profile & "My Reports" (`/my-reports`)**:
  - Simulated active user: **Alex Johnson** (`alex.johnson@campus.edu`).
  - View individual reports submitted by the current user.
  - Real-time status toggling to **"Mark as Returned"** which updates statistics across the whole application.
  - Accessible confirmation modal for deleting listings.
  - Demo reset button to restore default sample records at any time.
